###Abstract
The aim of this paper is to provide a method to solve linear Ordinar Differential Equation (ODE) with constant coefficient with the load as Dirac function.
I tried to find a method for solve such ODEs. I've only founded solutions for First and Second order's ODE. So I decided to (re-)invent it.
To understand this paper there is only need to have a basic understanding of ODE, Laplas Transform and Linear Algebra.
