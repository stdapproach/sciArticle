d) Impulse response + Control Theory
The transfer function of a continuous time system is the Laplace transform of
its response to an impulse (Dirac’s delta) with zero initial conditions.

+Genta p.180
	The impulse response h(t) completely characterizes the system. Its Laplace transform can be immediately computed by multiplying the Laplace transform of the Dirac’s δ by the transfer function of the system:

-Karris Chapter 6
	The Impulse Response and Convolution
	The impulse response is the output (voltage or current) of a network when the input is the delta
function
	part 6-1 impulse response in term state-space (p.183)

Kelly p.315
	The unit impulse function (t) is the mathematical
representation of a force required to provide a unit impulse to a system. It possesses the
properties of an impulsive force. It is zero except at t  0, where it is infinite; yet its integral
over time is equal to 1. Use of the unit impulse function as the forcing function in the
differential equation gives
	The solution of the differential equation is h(t), which is called the impulsive response.

	+p.370
		The response of a system due to a unit impulse can be determined as the free response
with zero initial displacement and an initial velocity equal to velocity imparted by the
impulse

	The impulse response function at the point c > 0 of the linear
operator L(y) = y00 + a1 y0 + a0 y, with a1, a0 constants, is the solution yδ, in the sense of
Laplace Transforms, of the initial value problem

	Comments on Generalized Sources. We have used the Laplace Transform to
solve differential equations with the Dirac Delta as a source function. It may be convenient
to understand a bit more clearly what we have done, since the Dirac Delta is not an ordinary
function but a generalized function defined by a limit. Consider the following example

Ogata p.16
	The transfer function of a system is a mathematical model in that it is an operational method of expressing the differential equation that relates the output variable to the input variable.

	Impulse-Response Function.
	Since the Laplace transform of the unit-impulse function is unity, the Laplace transform of the
output of the system is
	The inverse Laplace transform of the output given by Equation (2–2) gives the impulse
response of the system. The inverse Laplace transform of G(s), or
	is called the impulse-response function. This function g(t) is also called the weighting
function of the system.
Ogata p.17
	+The impulse-response function g(t) is thus the response of a linear time-invariant
system to a unit-impulse input when the initial conditions are zero.The Laplace transform of this function gives the transfer function. 
	+Therefore, the transfer function and
impulse-response function of a linear, time-invariant system contain the same information about the system dynamics. It is hence possible to obtain complete information about the dynamic characteristics of the system by exciting it with an impulse
input and measuring the response. (In practice, a pulse input with a very short duration compared with the significant time constants of the system can be considered an
impulse.)
