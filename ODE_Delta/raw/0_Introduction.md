###Introduction
The dynamics of evolving processes is often subjected to abrupt changes such as:
• impact by hammer to a beam,
• a bat striking a ball or a bolt of lightning striking a tower.

Often these short-term perturbations are treated as having acted instantaneously or in the form of “impulses”. Acording to Rao (p.381) impulsive force - a forse that has a large magnitude and acts for a very short time.
In this case, the output corresponding to this sudden force is referred to as the impulse response function (IFR). Mathematically, an impulse can be modeled by an initial value problem (IVP) with a special type of function known as the Dirac delta function as the external force, i.e., the non-homogeneous term. The impulse response of a system is its response to the input $\delta(t)$ when the system is initially at rest.
According to Cohen (p.13) "The impulse function is useful when we are trying to model physical situations, such as the case of two billiard balls impinging, where we have a large force acting for a short time which produces a flnite change of momentum."

We've tried to find a method for solve such kind systems. We only founded solutions for particular First and Second order's ODE. So we decided to (re-)invent it.

To understand this paper there is only need to have a basic knowledge of ODE, Laplace Transform and Linear Algebra.
