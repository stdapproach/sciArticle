###2 Linear Algebra (introduction)
-------------
System of algebraic equations are often come up when modelling many physical and engineering problems like:
* stresses and moments in complicated structures
* hydraulic head at junctions and the rate of flow for connecting pipes
* flight and ticket availability in airline scheduling
* elemental values in the numerical implementation of a finite element method for solving boundary value problems (useful in arbitrary geometrical configurations)

In any of these contexts, the system of algebraic equations that we must
solve will in many cases be linear or at least can be well approximated by
a linear system of equations. Linear algebraic equations are characterized
by the property that no variable is raised to a power other than one or is
multiplied by any other variable.

This brief introduction is belonged to following topics:
* Linear Equations
* Matrix Algebra
* Determinants
* Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
