####Abstract
This article is devoted to matrix Ordinal Differential Equations (ODE) with constant coefficient, with terms consisting of Dirac delta functions. The algorithm to exchange the original non-homogenous ODE with non-null initial condition (IC) to a homogenous one with different IC is provided. The resulting ODE could be solved analytical or numerical method with. Provided some examples with known analitycal solution to check the algorythm.
